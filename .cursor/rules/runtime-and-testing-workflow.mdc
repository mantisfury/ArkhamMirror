# Runtime, Refresh, and Testing Workflow

## Assume servers are already running

- Do **not** start dev servers, API servers, or background watchers from the assistant.
- Assume servers are running with **automatic refresh** already enabled.
- If a live refresh/reload is needed, **ask the user to trigger it** (refresh browser, restart service, redeploy container, etc.).

## Endpoint testing

- Prefer testing endpoints with `curl` (or an equivalent HTTP client) instead of spinning up or restarting servers.
- If you need the user to run a request locally (auth, TLS, localhost-only), ask them to run the `curl` command and paste results.

## Database access

- When inspecting the database, use credentials from the repo’s `.env` (or `.env.example` as a template if `.env` is unavailable).
- View/query the database directly using those credentials rather than trying to infer state indirectly.
